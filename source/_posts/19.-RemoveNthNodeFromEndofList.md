Question:  
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.  

Example:
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
Note:  
Given n will always be valid.

Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    //one pass with two pointer
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode high = head, low = head;
        for(int i = n; i > 0; i--){
            high = high.next;
        }
        if(high == null)            //if deleting the first node of this linked list, should be care of the first pointer exception.
            return head.next;
        while(high.next != null){
            high = high.next;
            low = low.next;
        }
        low.next = low.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```
